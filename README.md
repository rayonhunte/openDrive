# OpenDrive

## Description

This is a public version of a private project, that demos user Auth using Firebase, AngularFire2 and Angular7.

## Work In Progress

I am still working on this, as I refine this aspect of the project I will update this repository.
[I am also working on a video that I will post to my YouTube Page] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIkteVnhcbJJjBA6gTTEtjQ?view_as=subscriber)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
